- 👋 Hi, I’m Al
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly driving hardware devices, coding is difficult for me, I'm more of the "build it" type. Wires, sodering, and lab scoping are what I enjoy most. I'm an automotive technician, so that explains the wanting to work with hardware more. But I do need someone who likes to code. You code, I'll build.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++ but I'm slow at it
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, um. Stuff, I've got a ton of little projects going on, but I'd really like to get into Solar projects as soon as possible, I'm willing to start now. It's going to be needed more in the future here, so we'd better start.
- 📫 How to reach me drummer514@yahoo.com. Only seriously enquires please.
- 🌍🌎🌏 Let's work to stop ruining our home.
- 🚗🚐 And yes, if you're having issues with your vehicle I'm more than happy to lend a hand or at least give an idea of what the problem could be.
